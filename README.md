# [Playstation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console)) for [MiSTer Platform](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki)
by [Robert Peip](https://github.com/RobertPeip/)

## Hardware Requirements
SDRAM of any size is required.

## Features
* Savestates
* Option for core pause when OSD is open
* Optional manual Memory Card file loading (.MCD)
* CUE+BIN and CHD format support
* Multiple Disc Game support with Lid open/close toggle
* Fast Boot (Skips BIOS)
* Dithering On/Off Toggle
* Bob or Weave Deinterlacing
* Inputs: Digital, Analog, Mouse, NeGcon, and Guncon support.

## Bios
Rename your playstation bios file (e.g. `scph-1001.bin`/`ps-22a.bin` ) to `boot.rom` and place it in the `./games/PSX/` folder.

You can also place a cd_bios.rom in the same directory as the CD or 1 directory above, to have it uses together with that CD. This can be used for games that depend on the BIOS region(US,EU,JP).

## Memory Card
One card can be mounted for each controller slot. Cards are in raw .mcd format. An empty formatted .mcd file is available for [download here](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/PSX_MiSTer/raw/main/memcard/empty.mcd).

You need to save them either manually in the OSD or turn on autosave. Saving or loading a card will pause the core for a short time.

## Multiple Disc Games
To swap discs while the game is running, you will need have all of the disc files for the game placed in the same folder. Then when loading a new disc for most games you will need to toggle the Lid Open/Close option to tell the game you have opened the lid and closed it. Example folder structure of a multi disc game:

```
/media/fat/games/PSX/Final Fantasy VII (USA)/Final Fantasy VII (USA) (Disc 1).chd
/media/fat/games/PSX/Final Fantasy VII (USA)/Final Fantasy VII (USA) (Disc 2).chd
/media/fat/games/PSX/Final Fantasy VII (USA)/Final Fantasy VII (USA) (Disc 3).chd
```

## Video output
Core uses either normal output or direct framebuffer mode.

In Framebuffer mode you can choose to view:
- normal drawing area without any overscan cutoff
- full VRAM as 1024x512 pixel image (debug mode)

## Libcrypt

Some games are secured with Libcrypt and will not work if it's not circumvented.

You can provide a .sbi file to do that.
If there is a .sbi file next to a .cue with the same name, it is loaded automatically when mounting the CD image.

## Error messages

If there is a recognized problem, an overlay is displayed, showing which error has occured.
You can hide these messages with an OSD option, by default they are on.

List of Errors:
- E2     - CPU exception(only relevant if game shows issues)
- E3..E6 - GPU hangs (e.g. corrupt display list)
- E7     - CPU2VRAM with mask-AND enabled
- E8     - DMA chopping enabled
- E9     - GPU FIFO overflow
- EA     - SPU timeout
- EB     - DMA and CPU interlock error 
- EC     - DMA FIFO overflow
- ED     - CPU Data/Bus request timeout
- EE     - Dotclock used as timer report(only relevant if game shows issues)

## Debug Options

The debug menu is intended for use by developers only. They don't really serve any purpose for regular users so it's best to leave them at their default setting as a lot of undesirable behavior could occur.

## Pad Options
The following pad types are emulated by the core and can be independently assigned to each port:
- Digital  
  (ID 0x41) Ten button digital pad.
- Analog  
  (ID 0x73) Twinstick pad.  
  Currently does not support rumble function or the configuration protocol, so older games might not detect it.
- Mouse  
  (ID 0x12) Two button mouse.
- Off  
  Pad unplugged from port.
- GunCon  
  (ID 0x62) GunCon compatible lightgun.
- NeGcon  
  (ID 0x23) NeGcon compatible racing pad.  
  Primarily developed for dual analog stick usage with the following mapping (genuine NeGcons  
   may work if usb adapters map steering to Left Analog and I/II to Right Analog):
   - Steering -> Left Analog
   - Circle -> Circle
   - Triangle -> Triangle
   - I -> Right Analog Up, Cross (100% pressed), R2 (100% pressed)
   - II -> Right Analog Down, Rectangle (100% pressed), L2 (100% pressed)
   - L -> L1 (100% pressed)
   - R -> R1

## Status

Work in progress, don't report any bugs!

- some games working

--
